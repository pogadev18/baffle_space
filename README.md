# Welcome to the official repo of Baffle.space

On this repository you can see the Web3 implementation of our dAPP using: Next.js, TypeScript and Moralis DB.

## Instalation and running

In order to join the Baffle.space project as an observer or as a contributor, the required steps to build from source and setup explicitly are explained below.

If you want to have a look at the code and run the project locally, we would appreciate if you could send us a message on our social media channels so we can discuss
other technical aspects.

### Step 1: fork and clone the repository on your local machine
### Step 2: install the npm dependencies and then run the dev env as follows:


```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

In order to have a fully working local environemnt, you might need some env variables.
We can give you access to them after you contact us.
