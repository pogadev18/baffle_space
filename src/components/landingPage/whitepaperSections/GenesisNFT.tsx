        Baffle Space Genesis NFT Collection
      </Heading>
      <p>
        UniWhale NFTs will be the digital assets of Baffle Space. Through them NFT owners hold
        uncapped and perpetual earning powers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of owning an NFT as having the paperwork for your own business within the Baffle Space
        Ecosystem, an affiliate business on the blockchain with chances to win Dream Prizes. The
        more people you manage to bring to mint their NFT using your referral link and play for the
        Dream Prizes Baffle Space offers, the more you will earn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bringing people to mint and play will increase your earnings, on top of your chances to win
        the Dream Prizes when Baffle Space Games start.
