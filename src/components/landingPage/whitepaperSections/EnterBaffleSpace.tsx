        We are set to prove through our project that the crypto space actually brings value to
        people and is able to provide value transfer effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        When people only need a small amount to test the crypto space, their exposure to the
        volatility of the crypto space goes through now, in its infancy, is minimal, but with huge
        benefits, people become more likely to believe in it and adopt it as a trustworthy value
        transfer system.
      </p>
      <p>
        We chose raffles as the way to aid people to step into the crypto space because we believe
        bringing tangible, real world prizes to people for the small price of a lottery ticket
        purchased with crypto ($MATIC), paves the way, our way to mass adoption for cryptocurrency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Baffle Space is the play to win and earn raffle dApp based on the Polygon blockchain to
        bridge the gap between the crypto space and the real world.
