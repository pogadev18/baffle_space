        Baffle Space Games Start NFT
      </Heading>
      <p>
        Shortly after the NFT minting will be accomplished the Baffle Space Gaming dApp will be
        launched (check the roadmap to see the timeline).
      </p>
      <p>
        When Baffle Space Games start, you will get to experience the day-to-day ownership of the
        business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eg: You have a following on social media platforms. It iss time to leverage it once again.
        Offer your followers discounts for tickets through a second referral link you will be able
        to find in your dashboard when you login with MetaMask.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will have at your disposal 5% from ticket prices to determine this part of your business
        strategy. How much you offer as a discount to get people to buy their tickets using your
        referral link and how much you keep for yourself. You will be able to set the discount
        percentage for your referral link from 0%-5%.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Cumulative discounts</strong>
          <p>
            When people buy ticket packages for Dream Prizes using your second referral link, the
            discount you offer them, adds up to the discount we offer all players for purchasing
            multiple ticket packages for increased chances of winning.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Increasing your share</strong>
          <p>
            After the accumulation step is completed and the validation amount is passed, the
            tickets bought using your referral link will increase the weight of your share as they
            will count as if they were bought by you. This means your piece from the 60% pie above
            the validation amount will be far greater and bring you more earnings.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Descendant NFT Creation</strong>
          <p>
            Baffle Space Genesis NFT owners will have the ability to generate
            &ldquo;offspring&rdquo; NFTs, free of charge ( minus minting/transaction fees). You, as
            the owner will have the option to distribute them for free or sell them on opensea.io
            marketplace. Think of them as descendants who are also your employees. You will have to
            care for them by keeping them up to date with Baffle Space Games because 5% of each
            ticket they purchase will accumulate to your earnings. As long as they play for Dream
            Prizes in Baffle Space Games you will earn. We want to emphasize that all these earnings
            are on top of your affiliate link earnings and the chances(tickets) you purchase
            yourself for each Dream Prize.
